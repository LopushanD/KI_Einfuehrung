        - review responsibilities of Field and DrawingInformationHolder classes. If needed adjust their code accordingly
                * also refactor both classes

        - add "simple" GUI configuration mode.

                * Current configuration mode will be "advanced". It stays as it is. 
        
        - write documentation for the program
