TO DO
        
        
        - Now when there's no path, you get exception. Turn it into pop up, that tells that there's no way available
        
        - now some combinations of size (field or grid or tile), padding, margin lead to out of index error. look into it.
        
        - write documentation for the program
        
        - upgrade random obstacle generator
        
        - transform dialogs to GUI
