TO DO
        - think about restrictions of parameters that can be handled. Now you can freely choose any parameters for field and grid, that is prone to cause bugs 
        
        - change the classes so, that they can be more comfortably controlled from Controller class
                * like add specific attribut to classes that Controller class can look at, to know that should be done next 
        
        
        - Now when there's no path, you get expection. Turn it into pop up, that tells that there's no way available
        
        - go through code and program architecture and refactor it where needed
        
        - write documentation for the program
        
        - upgrade random obstacle generator
        
        - transform dialogs to GUI
